# VuePress-Start

*Starter template for a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) site*  

## Requirements  

**Node >= 8**, **Yarn** and **VuePress** should be installed before you start. We also need a free **Github** and **Netlify** account to follow this example.  

You can check that on your computer in your terminal: 

$ node --version  
$ yarn --version  
$ vuepress --version

If you see a version number then the software is installed otherwise you need to download and install  

[Node Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
[Yarn Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)  


#### Global Installation of VuePress  

yarn global add vuepress # OR npm install -g vuepress  


if you need to update..

## Quickstart 

Use the one-click deploy button and get a copy of this base-template as a repositary in your own GitHub account and additionally
a live-server version on Netlify for free. Every change in the GitHub README.md file will automatically cause a change 
on this server.
