# VuePress

*This is a Starter template for a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) site and it integrates the NetlifyCMS with VuePress. 
VuePress is focused on content-centric static sites and provides features tailored for technical documentation out of the box.*




## Quickstart 

[Life Demo on Netlify](https://pedantic-shannon-ec4e1f.netlify.com)

Use the one-click deploy button and get a copy of this base-template as a repositary in your own GitHub account and additionally
a live-server version on Netlify for free. Every change in the GitHub **README.md** file will then automatically change 
on this server too.


## One-Click Deploy

``If you edit the files in Github direct, the changes are automatically done on the server too.``



# Create a Custom VuePress Theme with Vuetify

If you’ve heard of VuePress already you might know that it’s a powerfully minimal static site generator by Vue.js Creator Evan You. VuePress makes the creation of text-heavy documentation websites easy, a lot easier than Nuxt.js.

But, did you know that VuePress has a custom theme system built on top of Vue that lets you build your own fully featured themes with custom functionality?

In this tutorial, we’ll go over how you can get started creating your own custom theme, some best practices to follow, and how to integrate a UI pattern library like Vuetify for fast layout creation.

So let’s get started.

## Setting up a VuePress project

#### First, make sure that you have VuePress installed on your system.

`npm install -g vuepress`

check it out with: `vuepress --version` (in the moment 0.14.4)

#### Create a folder for your VuePress website with the following command:

`mkdir my-vuepress-project.`
